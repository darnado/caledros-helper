Adds an Admin Menu that allows removing the default block patterns. It also allows deactivating the WordPress REST API for non-authenticated users.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a custom Admin Menu with two checkboxes:

* The first checkbox allows the user to remove the core block patterns from the Gutenberg editor. This feature can be activated or deactivated.

* The second checkbox allows the user to deactivate the WordPress REST API for non-authenticated users. This feature can be activated or deactivated.

After plugin activation, both options will be disabled by default.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I deactivate the plugin features? =
Yes, both features can be easily deactivated from the custom Admin Menu added by the plugin.

= If I remove the default block patterns, are they gone forever? =
No. The plugin only disables theme support for the core block patterns while the option is active. If you turn off the option, the default block patterns will reappear.

= If I deactivate the REST API, is it gone forever? =
No. The REST API is only disabled while the checkbox is enabled. If you uncheck the option, the REST API will be re-enabled.

== Screenshots ==
